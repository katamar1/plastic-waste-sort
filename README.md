# plastic-waste-sort
An in development AI that uses DCT, Voronoi Diagrams, and GLCM to sort different types of plastic waste.

Current Step: Implement a Python Script that takes an image and performs a DCT transformation.
Next Step: Implement a Python script that makes a Voronoi diagram from an image.

Further Steps:
1) Implement a Python script that performs GLCM on an image given.
2) Extract features from previously given Python scripts.
3) Train the model using TensorFlow.
4) Make a basic UI/UX for the model.
